Intro to Scikit-Learn with Tim Hopper,1/16/2014,38,"<p>Abstract: Scikit-learn is an actively developed Python package providing an implementation of many machine learning algorithms (e.g. SVM, kNN, linear models, HMM, k-Means, spectral clustering). However, the benefits of Scikit-learn goes well beyond carefully implemented learning algorithms. Being built in Python, it allows easy integration with countless other Python modules for tasks such as plotting, data munging, and application development. Its consistent API across algorithms allows for rapid experimentation with multiple learning methods. Also, Scikit-learn is well documented and provides lots of examples.</p> <p>Instead of discussing particular machine learning algorithms provided by the package, I will focus on Scikit-learn and Python as a toolkit for solving data problems from start to finish. I will emphasize the Pipeline tool which allows the user to chain together all the steps of a machine learning pipeline including preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, and model fitting.</p> "

Presentation: Improved Inference in Generalized Linear Mixed Models,9/18/2014,25,"<p>In small samples it is well known that the standard methods for estimating variance components in a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), pseudo-likelihood and maximum likelihood, yield estimates that are biased downward. An important consequence of this is that inferences on fixed effects will have inflated Type I error rates because their precision is overstated. We introduce a new method for estimating parameters in GLMMs that applies a Firth bias adjustment to the maximum likelihood-based GLMM estimating algorithm. We apply this technique to one- and two-treatment logistic regression models with a single random effect. We show simulation results that demonstrate that the Firth-adjusted variance component estimates are substantially less biased than maximum likelihood estimates and that inferences using the Firth estimates maintain their Type I error rates more closely than the standard methods.</p> "

Functional Modeling of Longitudinal Data with Rajesh Selukar,4/16/2015,46,"<p><b>ABSTRACT</b></p> <p>In many studies, a continuous response variable is repeatedly measured over time on one or more subjects. The subjects might be grouped into different categories, such as cases and controls. The study of resulting observation profiles as functions of time is called functional data analysis. This paper shows how you can use the SSM procedure in SAS/ETS® software to model these functional data by using structural state space models (SSMs). A structural SSM decomposes a subject profile into latent components such as the group mean curve, the subject-specific deviation curve, and the covariate effects. The SSM procedure enables you to fit a rich class of structural SSMs, which permit latent components that have a wide variety of patterns. For example, the latent components can be different types of smoothing splines, including polynomial smoothing splines of any order and all L-splines up to order 2. The SSM procedure efficiently computes the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of the model parameters and the best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) of the latent components (and their derivatives). The paper presents several real-life examples that show how you can fit, diagnose, and select structural SSMs; test hypotheses about the latent components in the model; and interpolate and extrapolate these latent components.</p> "

Melissa Nysewander: Applied Data Science: Case Study in Workforce Analytics,10/15/2015,111,"<p>Doors open at 6:30 pm. </p> <p>Presentation starts at 7:00pm. </p> <p>Abstract: Data science is more than a single algorithm or technology, it is a methodology tying together scientific reasoning, hypothesis testing, machine learning, and statistics.  It’s about knowing enough programming to grab and manipulate data at the finest grain, and enough statistics to extract real (not spurious) insights.  But it’s also about being able to ask the right questions, design meaningful tests, and in the end, communicate results to the people making decisions.  This talk is a practical explanation of what it takes to successfully execute an enterprise-level data science project, from beginning to end, emphasizing both the soft and hard skills necessary to do so.  To illustrate, I will present a recent case study in workforce analytics in which we performed text analysis using Python &amp; R on scraped web data.</p> <p>After Party: </p> <p>Serena (<a href=""http://www.serena-rtp.com/""><a href=""http://www.serena-rtp.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.serena-rtp.com/</a></a>), 5311 S Miami Blvd, Durham, NC 27703.  Close by, good beer and tasty food.</p> <p><img src=""https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif"" /></p> "

Interpreting Decision-Tree Models with Ralph Haygood,1/17/2017,103,"<p>Doors Open at 6:30pm</p> <p>Presentation Starts at 7:00pm</p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p>Decision-tree models, particularly random forests and gradient-boosted tree models, are popular for both classification and regression tasks. For many tasks, they offer not only accurate predictions but also plain interpretations, that is, insights into the relationships between the input variables and the output variable: Which inputs are most influential? Which inputs combine non-additively? For practical purposes, answering these questions is often more important than providing accurate predictions per se. In this talk, I'll briefly introduce decision trees, random forests, and gradient-boosted tree models. I'll then explain and demonstrate (in Python) feature importances - Which inputs are most influential? - and feature interactions - Which inputs combine non-additively? Regarding feature interactions, I'll discuss Friedman-Popescu statistics, a topic from the research literature that I've found useful in my own practice.</p> "

Years of studying box scores and basketball cards can also play an integral role in developing an interest in data analysis (it worked for me!). Armed with data and a knowledge of statistical models, a fan can investigate theories or suspicions they have about their favorite sport. For example, is an NCSU basketball player at a disadvantage in the NBA draft compared to their counterparts at UNC or Duke? We will look into this matter as well as a couple other applications of analyzing basketball data. We'll also briefly introduce the modeling techniques used, such as the Plackett-Luce model for rankings and the Lasso and Generalized Lasso for variable selection.</p> <p>Clay Barker is a Senior Research Statistician Developer in the JMP group at SAS. Clay has developed a variety of platforms in JMP, including tools for variable selection, nonlinear modeling, and model-based clustering. Clay earned a PhD in Statistics from North Carolina State University. When not hanging out with his wife and daughters, Clay enjoys basketball, golf, and craft beer.</p> "

SQL on Hadoop and Modern Analytic Databases with Ian Cook,7/18/2017,92,"<p>Doors at 6:30pm</p> <p>Presentation Starts at 7:00pm</p> <p>SQL is widely used by analysts to query relational databases and data warehouses. In the last ten years, as the data stored by companies has grown exponentially larger, the costs of storing it in traditional databases has soared. To achieve lower costs and greater scalability, companies have stored more of their ever-growing data on distributed platforms like Hadoop and in services like Amazon S3. Tools like Apache Hive, Apache Impala, and others have been developed to allow analysts to query this petabyte-scale data using familiar SQL syntax. Join us for a tour through the history of relational databases and the rise of SQL on Hadoop and modern analytic databases.

Building a Continuous Learning Algorithm from Logged Data with Zeydy Ortiz,9/19/2017,91,"<p>Logged data from business processes contain a treasure trove of information that usually remains untapped.  Now that businesses have many more instrumented processes with IoT devices, the data collected is bound to increase.  In many cases, businesses collect the data to answer: 'what happened?'  However, this information could also  be used to anticipate what is likely to happen.  In particular, we could use the data collected to determine how long a given process is expected to take to complete.</p> <p>In this presentation, I will present a case study on building a continuous learning algorithm to predict how long an Ansible playbook will take to execute.  Ansible is a tool that IT organizations use to automate tasks.  A developer could go for a cup of coffee or out to lunch only if they know how long the build would take.  The historical data stored in Logstash (from the Elastic Stack) will be used to feed a k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm for predictions.</p> <p>Zeydy Ortiz, Ph. D. is the co-founder and CEO of DataCrunch Lab.  She helps teams and organizations translate data into actionable insights for operational efficiency.  Her interests include incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning into Internet of Things applications.  She is also the organizer of NC Data4Good bringing together social good organizations and data scientists to make an impact in our communities.  Dr. Ortiz has a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Puerto Rico, a Master's in Computer Science from Texas A&amp;M University and a doctorate from NC State University.  Before focusing on data science, she was a performance engineer at IBM developing predictive models to forecast the performance of servers.  She lives in Cary with her two kids, two dogs and her husband.</p> "

Tackling billion dollar problems with data: with Shoresh Shafei,1/16/2018,80,"<p>Doors: 6:30pm<br/>Presentation starts: 7:00pm</p> <p>Snacks and drinks provided by Spreedly!<br/><a href=""https://www.spreedly.com/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.spreedly.com/</a></p> <p>Financial Technology (FinTech) companies, that employ technology to facilitate banking and financial services, have to deal with multi billion dollar problems such as credit card declines and fraud prevention. In fact, around $146 billion in credit card purchases are declined annually and in 2015 alone, global credit card and debit card fraud resulted in a $21.84 billion loss.</p> <p>Our unprecedented ability to store, analyze and learn from huge datasets has motivated fintech companies to invest in and take advantage of data science to predict declines, identify fraudulent transactions, prevent losses and capture more revenue by reducing the number of ""false declines"" that result from overly zealous fraud controls.</p> <p>Spreedly, a fintech company in downtown Durham, allows merchants to store and tokenize credit card information and use them against multiple payment gateways through one unique API. This positions Spreedly between merchants and payment providers and gives it a unique access to payment methods, payment gateways, and transactional data which, in turn, can be used to generate insights into the payment industry.</p> <p>In this presentation, Shoresh will introduce the basic concepts in payment and discuss how the analytics team at Spreedly is using the data to tackle the billion dollar problems in financial industry.</p> "

Challenges in Implementing Analytical Solutions with Walt DeGrange,5/15/2018,63,"<p>We have all attended presentations either telling how great an analytical solution performed or how to successfully implement a solution or technique. It isn't a surprise to seasoned analytical professionals that most analytical projects are not successfully implemented. Unfortunately, due to selection bias, these projects are seldom presented. Medicine has a long history of using morbidity and mortality briefs to learn and advance the profession. These briefs share stories on negative outcomes and the events and decisions that led to those outcomes. This presentation uses the morbidity and mortality model and will take examples from analysis performed from the desert of Iraq, to the South China Sea, to the ice of the St. Louis Blue's Scottrade Center hockey rink to share negative outcomes and the lessons to be learned.</p> <p>SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SAS SECURITY<br/>SAS Security needs your FULL NAME two days prior to the Meetup.

Building Control Groups for Observational Studies with Steven Few,7/17/2018,43,"<p>Doors: 6:30pm<br/>Talk Starts: 7:00pm</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>This talk covers examples and methods associated with statistical comparisons of two groups in observational studies, when pre-processing (matching) is needed to improve Causal Modeling (inference). The gold standard for causal relationships is controlled experiments, where groups are randomly chosen to receive or not receive a treatment, but what about when circumstances (or ethics) prevent you from doing random assignment? Real-word examples include exposure to harmful chemicals or behaviors such as smoking.</p> <p>This talks shows how factors such as age, gender, and other demographics, can be used as the covariates in a model to create a score during preprocessing. Then, subjects that cause confounding of results can be removed in order to improve the “causal inference” of interest, and those controls that best match the treatment group can be included. These techniques provide a statistical basis for creating an ""after the fact"" control group that can be used to provide better statistical inference.</p> <p>We cover R coding requirements, data management, modeling responses using the R package - CEM, and SAS code. Other MS or Linux tools could be included in the data work flow. Some of the stories and anecdotes are actually true. Related R Code : <a href=""http://cran.r-project.org/"" class=""linkified"">http://cran.r-project.org/</a> . One R package, CEM, can be used.

Driving User Adoption with Paul McHale,9/18/2018,35,"<p>There is no shortage of resources to help bring your data to life through interactive dashboards. Often overlooked, though, is the nuance required to successfully implement a self-service suite of reports. For most audiences, understanding the importance of the data is not enough to drive interaction with a self-service tool. The tool must spark their curiosity; it must allow the audience to draw meaningful comparisons between themselves (or their org) and some benchmark. But, what do you do if no meaningful benchmark exists?</p> <p>Join the Research Triangle Analysts Meetup on September 18th as Paul McHale leads a discussion on driving user adoption (interacting with the data versus observing) and finding meaningful comparisons within your data in the absence of benchmarks.</p> "
Interpretable Machine Learning with Dr Cynthia Rudin ,10/16/2018,116,"<p>Doors open at 6:30pm<br/>Presentation starts at 7:00pm.</p> <p>With widespread use of machine learning, there have been serious societal consequences from using black box models for high-stakes decisions, including flawed models for medical imaging, and poor bail and parole decisions in criminal justice. Explanations for black box models are not reliable, and can be misleading. If we use interpretable models, they come with their own explanations, which are faithful to what the model actually computes. I will present work on optimal decision lists and interpretable neural networks for computer vision. In our applications, we have always been able to achieve interpretable models with the same accuracy as black box models.</p> <p>These new algorithms are able to achieve interpretable models with the same accuracy as black box models.</p> <p>Cynthia Rudin is an associate professor of computer science, electrical and computer engineering, and statistics at Duke University, and directs the Prediction Analysis Lab. Previously, Prof. Rudin held positions at MIT, Columbia, and NYU. She holds an undergraduate degree from the University at Buffalo, and a PhD in applied and computational mathematics from Princeton University. She is the recipient of the 2013 and 2016 INFORMS Innovative Applications in Analytics Awards, an NSF CAREER award, was named as one of the “Top 40 Under 40” by Poets and Quants in 2015, and was named by Businessinsider.com as one of the 12 most impressive professors at MIT in 2015. Work from her lab has won 10 best paper awards in the last 5 years.

I Don't Trust You. You Don't Trust Me. Let's Collaborate! with Erik Scott,2/19/2019,54,"<p>Imagine there are two millionaires. They want to know who has more money, but neither one wants to reveal how much money they have and neither one will trust a third party to make the determination. Is there a solution? Or suppose there are two people, one with secret data and the other with a secret formula. Can the secret formula be evaluated with the secret data, without decrypting the data and without revealing the formula? Finally, is there some way for one person to have a hand of cards and let someone across the network see a card from that hand—without the first person knowing which card was viewed and without the second person knowing what other cards were held? It wouldn't be much of a talk if the answers were ""no"", so what will follow is a brief outline of the solutions (Secure Multiparty Computation, Homomorphic Encryption, and Oblivious Transfer, respectively) and details of RENCI, Duke, and NIEHS's work toward making these methods easy to use. Solutions are broadly applicable in areas such as medical research, auctions, and coercion-resistant encryption.</p> <p>Join the Research Triangle Analysts Meetup on Tuesday, February 19th for this talk with Erik Scott, Senior Research Software Developer at RENCI.

Amazon Reviews and Statistical Text Analytics by Dr. Douglas Kline,1/21/2020,66,"<p>Determining a Short List of Amazon Reviews using Statistical Text Analytics and Optimization</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Customers want to make informed purchasing decisions without a lot of effort. Online reviews can be helpful, but which reviews are worth reading? What we could say ""Read these 3 reviews, they essentially contain the same information as all 4000 reviews.""? I'll present a method for selecting subsets of reviews that are similar to the set of all reviews, using document-term frequency analysis and integer programming optimization. The technique is demonstrated on three products with 2000+ reviews from Amazon: a book, an article of clothing, and an electronic device. I'll present the basics of statistical text analysis, and some of the pros and cons of typical pre-processing methods such as stop-word removal and stemming when applied across corpus. The project is not completed or published yet, but preliminary analysis shows how language differs across the product reviews, how pre-processing must be done carefully, and the dimensionality challenge of evaluating subsets from a large set.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Douglas Kline is a Professor of Information Systems at UNC Wilmington.

Developments in Natural Language Understanding (NLU/NLP) with Dhruv Sakalley,2/18/2020,90,"<p>There have been a lot of advancements in Natural Language Understanding in the last few years. Deep Learning experience Dhruv Sakalley will walk us through some of the latest techniques.</p> <p>From the speaker:<br/>""Language is the scaffold of our minds. We build our thoughts through language and it conditions how we experience and interact with the world."" - Yueng<br/>The goal of Natural Language Processing (NLP) as a discipline is to equip machines with the same comprehension capability of natural language as humans do. Since the year 2014, the field has garnered significant progress, owing to recent developments in deep learning, transfer learning and self-supervised learning with representation models.<br/>I'd like to present an overview of the historical milestones and demonstrate some of the advanced capabilities available out of the box for someone who wants to benefit from the progress thus far. We'll spend some time talking about Attention mechanisms, Transformer Architecture and some Sesame Street characters such as Elmo, BERT, Ernie et al.<br/>While an understanding of deep learning and transfer learning would help, it's not mandatory to benefit from the talk.</p> "

Tensorflow Probability with Dr. Melinda Thielbar,4/21/2020,83,"<p>Tensorflow Probability: What it is, and Why you'll love it! with Dr. Melinda Thielbar</p> <p>Zoom meeting opens at 6:30, talk begins at 7:00.</p> <p>Password is rta</p> <p>- Please stay on mute during the talk.<br/>- Use chat to ask questions. We will ask the speaker questions at the end.</p> <p>Tensorflow probability is a new package from Google that enables probabilistic programming. In its simplest form, it allows you to specify the distribution of the target variable and estimate its parameters in just a few lines of code. Instead of shoe-horning a known function of X and Y into one of several pre-programmed and varyingly inappropriate functional forms, Tensorflow Probability is flexible enough to accommodate the most appropriate model for the problem at hand and powerful enough to estimate the parameters to the best of your data’s ability.</p> <p>- Is your outcome a count? Maybe something like the number of new cases of a novel disease that appear every day? Use a Poisson as the statistics gods intended.<br/>- Are you trying to estimate far too many effects? Use a Bayesian model and let your priors handle the messy middle.<br/>- Do you have too much data for your laptop’s tiny memory? Too much processing for any one CPU to finish in a year? Tensorflow Probability is GPU-enabled. Give your little CPU a rest and actually see the results of your labors while you’re still interested enough to enjoy them.</p> <p>This presentation will cover several examples that illustrate the possibilities (and the probabilities) of Tensorflow’s newest and nerdiest family member.</p> "

What is a climate model projection, what can it tell us, and what can it not tell us about the 21st century? In this talk, we will explore basic principles of climate science, look at a few recent results on climate change from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and talk about how climate data products are impacting industry (and the insurance industry in particular).</p> <p>Despite the wealth of scientific expertise (thousands of scientists, millions of research dollars, petabytes of data, petaflops of computing power), the ability of these climate data products to influence stakeholders and society at large is not at all assured. We will turn our attention to a few of the reasons for this. These include so-called type 3 errors (the right statistical answer to the wrong question), challenges with communicating big data analytics to stakeholders who may be less well-versed in the subject matter, and challenges with capturing and communicating uncertainty in projections.</p> <p>The speaker will draw on experiences in both academia and the insurance industry over the past 15 years. No particular scientific knowledge will be assumed.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Business cards, a 50-minute talk if you want to pitch a presentation, and your winning personality.</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>Analytics&gt;Forward is a community event.
